## So Long – Functional & Simplified for Learning

This project was developed overnight to help a colleague understand and implement the So Long project under extreme time constraints. To achieve this, the focus was placed entirely on functionality, with the creative aspects cut down to meet the deadline.

While it does not follow all the project’s requirements, it implements the core mechanics, including parsing, memory management, and game logic, which I considered essential. Some features, like the move counter and proper scaling, were left out due to time constraints.

This project was not intended for submission and does not comply with Norminette requirements. It serves as a learning resource for 42 students who want a simplified yet functional reference for So Long.
